<h2> Admin Panel Setup <h2>
  
To start off setting up roles for your osTicket we will be in the admin panel of this program and will be setting up roles under the agents tab. From there I created a role for supreme admin that way that role is above everyone elses.

Still under the agents tab we will move on to creating teams which will allow us to send tickets to certain teams for different situations. We will create a level I support team and level support II team and from there you will be able to put your agents within those groups.
