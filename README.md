# os-Ticket-Post-Installation


This tutorial outlines everything from setting up agents to assigning roles and putting your team members in their appropriate positions to carry out their job.


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- osTicket

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2> Admin Panel Setup <h2>
  
To start off setting up roles for your osTicket we will be in the admin panel of this program and will be setting up roles under the agents tab. From there I created a role for supreme admin that way that role is above everyone elses.

Still under the agents tab we will move on to creating teams which will allow us to send tickets to certain teams for different situations. We will create a level I support team and level support II team and from there you will be able to put your agents within those groups.

  For the next section we will setup the department which is still under agents tab in admin panel. I created the system administrators department so overall problems will be directed to agents who will be responsible for fixing the osTicket software problems.

  We will need agents for multiple roles within osTicket so we will be setting up employees for theses roles and departments. In the picture below you will see that I've created agents that will help carry out tickets also I made one of the agent a system admin so they'll have access to everything needed.
